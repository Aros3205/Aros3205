# Tolulope Richard Arowobusoye Cybersecurity Analyst
�� Hello! I’m **Tolulope Richard Arowobusoye**, a results-driven Cybersecurity Analyst with two years o
experience protecting cloud and on-prem infrastructures. My work focuses on threat detection,
vulnerability management, and continuous security monitoring. This repository gathers the lab
projects and reference guides that demonstrate my technical depth and commitment to secure-
by-design principles.
